**Hypixel Skyblock Shard Calculator**
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**WARNING**:
This is a very early prototype, and almost certainly has many errors, bugs and crashes.
It is horrendously structured, and quite unintuitive.
Use at your own risk, and doouble-check any results before spending a lot.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
**Usage**:

'get_bazaar_data.py' fetches bazaar price data from hypixel's api every 30 minutes. 

'shard_calculator' prints out a list of fusion crafts, ordered by profit per craft
- Change 'buy_order' and 'sell_order' variables if you don't want to instabuy/sell. This will increase profit a lot.
- Set the CROCODILE_LEVEL variable to the level of your Crocodile shard. This will add random chance to your profits, so feel free to leave at 0
- The 'snapshot' variable is the timestamp of the bazaar data the calculator will use. Change this to whatever the most recent data is.
